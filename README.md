# Exploratory Data Analysis of the Best Books Ever using Python

Check out the Jupyter notebook here: https://jovian.ai/snoektim/snoek-best-books

In this project I will carry out exploratory data analysis using Python of the largest list on the Goodreads site: the Best Books Ever list. To this end, I will use a dataset available on Kaggle that harbors the complete list, consisting of 25 columns and 52,478 rows.

The goal of this project is to extract key insights regarding the ranking of the books on the list as well as uncover features of books that have made it to (the top of) the list.

The outline of this notebook is given below:

1. Preparations, including Downloading the dataset
2. Data Preparation and Cleaning
3. Exploratory Analysis and Visualization
4. Asking and Answering Questions
5. Inferences and Conclusion
6. Future Work and References
